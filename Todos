Find frequency of buzzer/speaker and make sure it's consistent
Remove unwanted frequencies from fourier output (wait until after above task is done)
Inverse FFT (z)
Test auto/cross correlation to see which is better or more consistent (can be done now)
Make the correlation work and get time (after above)
Plug time into speed of sound formula to get distance  (easy)
